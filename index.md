# Workshop on Type-driven Development (TyDe)

The workshop on Type-driven Development aims to show how static type information may be used effectively in the development of computer programs.
Colocated with [ICFP](https://icfpconference.org), this workshop brings together leading researchers and practitioners who are using or exploring types as a means of program development.

## Upcoming workshop

2024, Milan

## Steering committee

The TyDe Workshop steering committee comprises three pairs of TyDe Workshop co-chairs and two appointed members-at-large.

Each year, shortly after the date of the TyDe Workshop, the steering committee appoints two co-chairs for the next TyDe Workshop. The steering committee additionally appoints a new member-at-large to succeed the currently longest serving member-at-large, if their two-year term is expiring. The newly appointed co-chairs and member-at-large then join the steering committee, while the longest serving former co-chairs and member-at-large step down.

The chair of the steering committee is one of the two longest serving co-chairs.

Should there be vacancies within the steering committee, e.g. due to a member stepping down early, the steering committee appoints members to fill the vacancies and, if necessary, decides on the succession ordering.
