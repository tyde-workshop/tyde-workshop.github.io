# 6th Workshop on Type-driven Development (TyDe 2021)

## Goals of the workshop

The Workshop on Type-driven Development (TyDe) aims to show how static type information may be used effectively in the development of computer programs.
Co-located with ICFP, this workshop brings together leading researchers and practitioners who are using or exploring types as a means of program development.

## Call for submissions

We welcome all contributions, both theoretical and practical, on a range of topics including:

- dependently typed programming;
- generic programming;
- design and implementation of programming languages, exploiting types in novel ways;
- exploiting typed data, data dependent data, or type providers;
- static and dynamic analyses of typed programs;
- tools, IDEs, or testing tools exploiting type information;
- pearls, being elegant, instructive examples of types used in the derivation, calculation, or construction of programs.

### Program committee

- Hsiang-Shang ‘Josh’ Ko, Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taiwan (co-chair)
- Dominic Orchard, University of Kent, UK (co-chair)
- Kenichi Asai, Ochanomizu University, Japan
- Jean-Philippe Bernardy, University of Gothenburg, Sweden
- Liang-Ting Chen, Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taiwan
- Ornela Dardha, University of Glasgow, UK
- Martin Escardo, University of Birmingham, UK
- Patricia Johann, Appalachian State University, USA
- Neel Krishnaswami, University of Cambridge, UK
- Ana Milanova, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, USA
- Keiko Nakata, SAP Innovation Center Network, Potsdam, Germany
- KC Sivaramakrishnan, IIT Madras, India
- Stephanie Weirich, University of Pennsylvania, USA
- James Wood, University of Strathclyde, UK
- Beta Ziliani, FAMAF, UNC and CONICET, Argentina

### Proceedings and copyright

We will have formal proceedings, published by the ACM.
Accepted full papers will be included in the ACM Digital Library.
Authors must grant ACM publication rights upon acceptance, but may retain copyright if they wish.
Authors are encouraged to publish auxiliary material with their paper (source code, test data, and so forth).
The proceedings will be freely available for download from the ACM Digital Library from one week before the start of the conference until two weeks after the conference.

The official publication date is the date the papers are made available in the ACM Digital Library.
This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference.
The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

### Submission details

Submissions should fall into one of two categories:

- Regular research papers (12 pages)
- Extended abstracts (3 pages)

The bibliography will not be counted against the page limits for either category.

Regular research papers are expected to present novel and interesting research results, and will be included in the formal proceedings.
Extended abstracts should report work in progress that the authors would like to present at the workshop; they will be evaluated primarily for relevance and interest.
Extended abstracts will be distributed to workshop attendees but will not be published in the formal proceedings.

We welcome submissions from PC members (with the exception of the two co-chairs), but these submissions will be held to a higher standard.

Submission is handled through [HotCRP](https://tyde21.hotcrp.com).

All submissions should be in portable document format (PDF) and formatted using the [ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/).

*Note* that submissions should use the new ‘acmart’ format and the two-column ‘sigplan’ subformat (not to be confused with the one-column ‘acmlarge’ subformat).

Extended abstracts must be submitted with the label ‘Extended abstract’ clearly in the title.

### Important dates

- May 19: Paper submission deadline
- May 26: Extended abstract submission deadline
- June 16: Author notification
- July 1: Camera-ready deadline
- Aug 22: Workshop

### Participant support

Student attendees with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant to help cover participation-related expenses.
PAC also offers other support, such as for child-care expenses during the meeting or for accommodations for members with physical disabilities.
For details on the PAC program, see its [web page](https://www.sigplan.org/PAC/).

## Keynote

### Wen Kokke: Integrating Agda with SMT-LIB – An incomplete list of pits I fell in

Last year, I set out on a journey to automatically prove some properties about floating-point computations in a whole host of different proof assistants. Eventually, I ended up writing Schmitty, which integrates Agda with SMT-LIB. In this talk, I’ll give an overview of the problems you’ll face integrating your favourite proof assistant with an external solver, and how different proof assistants chose to resolve – or not resolve – them.

## Schedule

*Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the workshop was held online along with ICFP 2021.*
*The schedule is shown in the time zone of Daejeon (UTC+9), where the workshop would have taken place if it had been held physically.*
